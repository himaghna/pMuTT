!The first line is the number of reactions. Subsequent lines follow the format
!of rxn (from surf.out) followed by the EA/RT value at each run condition.
!There may be one slight deviation from surf.out: any repeated species should
!be included in the reaction string with a stoichiometric coefficient equal to
!the number of times the species appears in the reaction. If not using
!MultiInput, then only the first value is used.
